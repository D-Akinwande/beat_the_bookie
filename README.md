# COMP0036: Beat the Bookie - Project Repository

## Project Overview
This repository is the central hub for the University College London's COMP0036 group project, "Beat the Bookie." Our aim is to develop a sophisticated machine learning model to predict the outcomes of English Premier League football matches using over a decade of historical data. This project is divided into three interconnected segments: Data Engineering, Model Development, and Report Writing.

## Repository Structure
This repository contains folders for each segment of our project:

- **Data Engineering**: This folder contains all the datasets, data cleaning scripts, preprocessing code, and feature engineering notebooks.
- **Model Development**: Here, you'll find the code for our predictive models, including initial drafts, testing scripts, and final versions.
- **Report Writing**: This section holds the LaTeX files for our project report, including drafts, figures, and the final compiled document.

### Data Engineering
The `Data_Engineering` directory includes:
- Raw and processed datasets.
- Jupyter notebooks and scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Documentation on data sources and processing steps.

### Model Development
The `Model_Development` directory includes:
- Source code for various model architectures.
- Scripts for model training, validation, and testing.
- Documentation on model selection and performance metrics.

### Report Writing
The `Report_Writing` directory includes:
- LaTeX source files for the project report.
- Compiled PDF versions of the report.
- Supporting graphics, tables, and figures used in the report.

## Collaboration Guidelines
- **Code Contribution**: Just commit directly from Colab, or your IDE/Terminal of choice
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages, explaining the changes and their purpose.
- **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and enhancements.
- **Code Reviews**: All *large* pull requests/entire codebase rewrites should be reviewed by at least one team member before merging.
- **Documentation**: Update relevant README files and comments in your code for clarity.

## Useful Resources for This Project
### For Data Engineering Team
(Below will basically be a list of datasets mentioned by all of the papers in our Zotero directory at the moment - generated using docAnalyzer by just linking all downloaded files in Zotero to the app. I would appreciate it, however, if you guys could scrape things like RSS feeds for text information or find other ways of getting data - like Kaggle datasets, datasets from universities, articles, and more. Or to use the research papers and your own additional research to find out where betting sites get their data from - databrokers and more. As seen from preliminary research and notes linked to Zotero, live information about matches, whether on social media or video, have a negligible effect on end predictions. Prior probabilities seem to have bigger effects.)

- [LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/)
- [Python Documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/)
### For Model Development Team
- [Made With ML](https://madewithml.com/): (This is a course for both machine learing and MLOPs. It gives comprehensive code snippets which we can easily integrate - deviously lick - into our project)
- [Machine Learning Bookcamp](https://mlbookcamp.com/): (This is a machine learning engineering course with less production-ready snippets but more explanations)
- [MLOps Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp): (This is from the same guys as above just its only about MLOPs)
- [The AI Summer](https://theaisummer.com): (This teaches all of the above but with a focus on reading research papers and implementing methods for yourself)
- [Deep Reinforcement Learning Course](https://simoninithomas.github.io/deep-rl-course/): (Only if we really need it/get the time to do any of it - see presentation)
### For Report Writing Team
- [Overleaf Template I Made - View Only](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ngcfvczygfxc#1ffc18): (You need to login to edit - using invite I sent)
- [LaTeX Project - Documentation](https://www.latex-project.org/): (Search up anything extra/google/research papers for specific methods of writing - as well as chatGPT lol)
- [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.ru/): (Do not use Sci-Hub as it gives you research paper pdf downloads for free >:( - Just leaving it here so you can *avoid* it)
- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com): (Google's database for papers + patents - papers with greater number of citations are most influential)
- [Elicit - Semantic research paper search engine](https://scholar.google.com): (Uses semantic search, basically just a bit of AI, to search for papers based on questions in your research)
- [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org): (Very similar to elicit but is free and has more stats - Only elicit can be used to ask questions to find papers)
- [Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com): (Using all previous steps will have found you some seed papers. Input into this to get connections graph of all related papers + save directly to Zotero - which I've set up to sync directly to your Overleaf document)
- [Doc Analyser](https://docanalyzer.ai/): (Basically chatGPT on steroids. Assuming the previous steps with finding papers and saving their PDFs e.t.c to zotero were done properly, get all pdfs in a directory - for entire coursework - and ask the AI questions about project. It responds with publication-level answers to put directly into the report as well as references - and their pages - from the documents you uploaded or provides notes on papers. Please use wisely and do not substitute AI for common sense + reading comprhension)
- [Very Useful Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DrAndyStapleton): (Very useful chanel of a post-Doc explaining study techniques and going into more detail about the tools I linked above)
- [Latex Tutorial Playlist 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxcWWkx2DMnQmj5os2X5ZR73): (Latex playlist - At 1.50x : 2 hours, 46 minutes, 37 seconds)
- [Latex Tutorial Playlist 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1D4EAB31D3EBC449): (Latex playlist - At 1.50x : 4 hours, 12 minutes, 54 seconds)
